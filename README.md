# synthkit
__SynthKit__ is a minimal, extensible Python toolkit for generating synthetic data using open-source models (Hugging Face) and, optionally, frontier model APIs. It provides clean abstractions for text augmentation, RAG-style question generation, and tabular row synthesis, with an optional Gradio UI for experimentation.
